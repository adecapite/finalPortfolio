I wnated to stick with my general theme of light pink, and miniamlist views for my portfolio as a whole.
Since not much desiging is present to achieve this I wanted to utilize more tools, such as Boostrap.

My footer:
![Contact me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77472956/122816375-a46cdf00-d2a4-11eb-848b-75b3c9aae439.png)
My footer I chose to double down and make it my contact information.
This was created using Bootstrap and SocialIcon, an imported tool that will find the logo of the social media site, or populates and universal icon such as the email.

My header:

With the same ideas as the footer, I created a header with purpose and made it into a navagation bar.
That navigation bar I wrote and styled using React native.
I created a seperate file for the mneu items for use of customization, and a sepreate CSS file for the styling, and imported both in the NavBar file.


While the styling of my portfolio is minimal, I wanted to demonsrate my understanding of the React language while also staying true to my brand design.
